`asor`, pronounced "TEN-soar" as `A` is `10` in hexadecimal.

`asor` is an extremely simple tensor library for resource constrained devices. It is designed to be used in embedded systems and IoT devices.

## Goals

- [ ] implement basic tensor ops
- [ ] implement simple mnist example
- [ ] implement vit example
- [ ] make `no_std` compatible
- [ ] add a llama example
- [ ] add a simple example for a microcontroller

## Design goals

- [ ] minimal/no dependencies
- [ ] brittle (strict and unchanging API)
- [ ] simple (familiar API, limited features)
- [ ] lots of test (easy to know what to expect)
- [ ] NO MAGIC! - we are anti magic ‚ùåü™Ñ
